I have been married to Jill for over 34 years and have two grown-up children and three grandchildren. I work as a data analyst but my heart is for people rather than figures. Jill and I lead the prayer team and are responsible for marriage ministries in Gateway. We are also part of the Couples in Crisis team working with Family Matters York.\n</p>",
