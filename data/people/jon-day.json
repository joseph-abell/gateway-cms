I work at Christians Against Poverty in Bradford, which was a dream job for me.. it was the main thing that prompted our family move up from London. I'm now the only southerner in a house of northerners! As a family we really enjoy people... our ideal is having a house full of diverse people relaxing, having fun, eating together and developing friendships.\n</p>",
