Gateway has been my home since my student days and I love helping with the youth work and organising monthly socials for 20-30 year olds. I’m passionate about helping others to connect with God and grow deeper in their knowledge of Him and the Bible. Global mission is also very much on my agenda – I long to see the nations find hope in Jesus. My other interests include: nursing, travel, hanging out with family and friends, going the gym, and most importantly...chocolate!\n</p>",
