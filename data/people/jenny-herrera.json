I am married to Josue and we have two children, Jonathan and Gabriela.  I enjoy the privilege of preaching and leading meetings and am passionate about ways our church can be an effective gateway to the Kingdom of God.  I also run a Christian charity called Acts 435 and am involved in a new charity that seeks to recognise responsible business practices.",
