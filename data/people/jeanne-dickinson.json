Getting to know God did not magically take away or prevent problems but gives me strength and hope through them.\n</p>\n<p>I work in the community as a carer and at Gateway I’m part of the “Welcome” team.  I’m happy to share my life experiences in order to encourage others.\n</p>\n<p>I am married to Gary with a son and daughter.\n</p>",
