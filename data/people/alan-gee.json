My wife, Steph, and I have been part of Gateway ever since we married and we now have two grown-up children. During the week, I'm occupied mostly working for a global financial technology company based out of our Yorkshire office in Shipley, near Bradford.\r\n\nFor us as a family, we've loved being part of Gateway, and particularly for it to have been the place where our children have been able to grow in their own relationships with Jesus. Having been around for a while, I've worn many \"hats\" over the years, but currently serve as one of the trustees.  As trustees, we work together with the Elders and members of our fabulous staff team in order to ensure that Gateway York CIO (our legal entity) uses its resources effectively and that we follow all of the many different pieces of legislation that apply to us as charity, as an employer, around safeguarding, the list goes on!  Apart from that, every once in a while, you can find Steph and me in the AV box at the back doing sound and words together.",
