Now back in York, I’m delighted to be able to serve as administrator in the Gateway office. You’ll also sometimes find me manning the Info Point on Sundays. I enjoy spending time with people from other countries and I regularly help at the Monday night international cafe in the Spurriergate Centre here in York.\n</p>",
