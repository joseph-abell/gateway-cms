    "paragraph": "We know that coming to a new city to study can be an exciting and challenging thing. As a church we're made up of people from all ages and backgrounds, including a small number of students. If you're looking for a friendly, welcoming church that feels like a family, then we think you'll love being part of the Gateway community.\nWe're currently meeting each Sunday on Zoom and YouTube, with limited attendees at our building in Acomb from Sunday 4th October. \nFor more information, please do get in touch via the Contact Us page.",
