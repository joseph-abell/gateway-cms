  "article": "Got questions about life? Eager to explore Christianity further? Then join us for an online Alpha. \n\nAlpha is an opportunity for people to investigate the Christian faith for themselves. Alpha is really for anyone who's curious. Exploring topics such as \"Is there more to life than this?\" and \"Who is Jesus?\"\n\nEach week will involve watching a 20-25 minute presentation, followed by an online discussion via video call. \n\nOur next Alpha starts 7.30pm on Tueday 12th January and runs for 7 weeks.\n\nSign up [here](https://gateway.churchsuite.co.uk/events/wra4jopn) or email us at office@gatewaychurch.co.uk."
