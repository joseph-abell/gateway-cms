Basically, if there’s a light out or something needs repairing, it’s me you would look for!\n</p>\n<p>I’m also very privileged to serve in various roles in our vibrant Children’s and Youth work teams. In the last three years I have learnt to play guitar and this comes in handy for leading the 5-10s in worship now and again and for our regular Youth worship band.\n</p>\n<p>I am also a keen gardener and love ‘golden age’ films from the 1930s-1960s especially Westerns.\n</p>",
