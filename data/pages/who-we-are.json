Both happen as we love and serve one another with the gifts he gives us. \n\n\nBecoming a disciple of Jesus changes our relationship with the world. God calls us to join him in his mission to GO and reach every person with the good news that Jesus is now King. Just as Jesus was sent into the world, he now sends us.",
